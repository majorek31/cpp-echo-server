# cpp-echo-server
Echo server that utilizes winsock2 and non-blocking sockets.

# how to use?
umm, idk how to say that but i haven't prepared any client app for now. use net cat with the specified port eg. ncat 127.0.0.1 42069
42069 is default port defined in server u can't change it without recompiling the server, why? cuz i'm bored.

This code is something like c mixed with cpp. For your safety please wear protective glasses.
Remember this is something that shows the way you shouldn't do your apps.
If you are considering using this in production code. press ALT + F4 NOW!!!!!
